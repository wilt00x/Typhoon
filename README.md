# Introduction

Typhoon is a security-oriented and cross-platform tool created for help exploit program's vulnerabilities by analyzing and extracting data from vulnerable binary file.

It can be used on **many architectures**, **file formats** and **operating-system**.

## Content of Typhoon's sections: 

**- A patcher in command line** -> v0.1 (write an hexadecimal string at a specific place)

**- A gadget finder** -> v0.1 (search for a piece of code ending with the 'ret' instruction)

**- A precise disassembler** -> v0.1 (starts disassembling the program from an address or an offset)

**- A ROPchain generator** -> v0.1 (generate a ropchain that can be executed or written in a file at any time)

**- An hexadecimal viewer / editor** -> v0.1 (observe the hexadecimal and ascii equivalent of the program or write a string at a specified location.)

## Available for which architectures?

i386, x86-64, ARM, MIPS.

## Available for which file formats?

Executable and Linking Format (ELF), Portable Executable (PE), Mach-O.

## Available for which operating-systems?

Microsoft Windows(All versions), GNU/Linux, IOS.

# Dependencies

This tool has been compiled with **gcc**, so it is necessary to have this compiler. You must also be able to use **make**.
